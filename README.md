### ATLP BACKEND
The backend code for the ATLP Project.

## General description
This is a backend project for the capstone project.
It is written in Javascript and uses ES6 style while the node version used in 16. The idea is to create a backend for a personal website that have a blog and allow admins to define tasks as well as manage the blogs. This version has been completed and deployed on my personal site.

## Technology Stack
1. Node.js
2. Express
3. Mocha (Testing)
4. Mongodb (Database)
5. Postmana (Local dev)
6. Swagger (Documentation)
## Servers

The API is hosted on Heroku on different pipelines.
